// Mirlo-N64's scan-out: the N64's VI_ORIGIN framebuffer (RGB565 as MRDP
// writes it: two pixels a word, the left one in the low half) to the
// Pocket's video pads: 320 x 240 at 59.94 Hz (and the other sizes, below), clk_vid
// 12.5 MHz = sys / 5.
//
//  - vid: a timing generator (the 320 x 240 set is the fixed one
//    the Pocket's scaler has been fed with); it never stalls -- a word the FIFO does not have in
//    time shows black.
//  - sys: at the frame boundary (the first line of vblank, from vid) the base
//    is latched from VI_ORIGIN (a new
//    origin never tears the frame being sent) and the frame's 38,400 words
//    are read in order into the FIFO: 64 KiB (16,384 words), which is what rides out the DRAM contention -- the
//    arbiter gives the scan-out no priority (a priority scheme was tried on
//    the Pocket and went badly; docs/n64.md).
//  - a hi-res framebuffer (VI_WIDTH 512 or more: 640 wide -- Pokemon Stadium's menus) is always shown in this 320 x 240
//    frame, reduced without a buffer: a word (two pixels) is read for each pixel shown and the two are averaged (2 x 1 box;
//    the left pixel alone, point sampling, was the first try: `havg` below); one that is 480 rows (vi_tall: VI yScale 2,
//    both fields' rows are in the buffer from the first field's origin) shows that first field alone, the buffer's even rows (every other row is skipped by the
//    reads). The VI's filters (below) are off for it. One pixel clock, 12.5 MHz, with video_skip.
//  - a framebuffer smaller than the screen (VI_WIDTH under 320: Banjo-Kazooie's 292 x 213) is shown as it is, a pixel a
//    pixel, black around it: its vi_rows rows of VI_WIDTH / 2 words are read
//    one after the other, and on the screen the picture starts vi_x0 pixels
//    in and vi_y0 lines down.
//  - the FIFO crosses sys -> vid; each word carries the frame's epoch bit, so
//    what is left of a frame is dropped by the vid side instead of resetting
//    a dual-clock FIFO.
//  - one frame size, the Pocket's scaler slot 0 (320 x 240): outside DE the pads are 0. `vblank` is the timing's vblank
//    as a sys level (APF_VIDEO).
//  - vi_latch: the frame boundary as a sys pulse, on the cycle of the vi_line of the line it is on (rcp_vi.sv counts
//    the lines from it).
//  - vi_line / vi_frame: each line's start and the frame's, as sys pulses --
//    the frame's four lines (a quarter of a millisecond) before the frame
//    boundary, when the base is latched: the VI interrupt, which a game answers
//    with its new framebuffer.
//  - OSD (a debug build: osd_en): 16 words (osd_val, sys) as hex in a box at
//    the top left, 8 lines of two -- the only window into the running SoC
//    without a UART, read through the HDMI capture. Read live across the
//    clock domains (no snapshot: 512 flip-flops the device does not have):
//    a value that changes while it is drawn may show torn for a frame.
