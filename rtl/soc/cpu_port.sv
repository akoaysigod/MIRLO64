// The game CPU on a clock of its own (MIRLO_CPU_CLK: docs/mips.md): its
// memory port -- what mips_sys asks of the SDRAM and of the devices -- taken
// across to the SoC's clock, in port_n64sys's place.
//
// The two clocks are outputs of one PLL, the CPU's a ratio of the SoC's
// (3/2: their rising edges meet every two cycles of the SoC's and are never
// closer than a sixth of that, 5.3 ns; 4/3: every three, 4.0 ns). Nothing
// here is asynchronous: every path from one clock to the other is from a
// register straight to a register, taken at every edge, and the timing
// analyser checks each at the closest pair of edges. What makes the crossing
// work is only that neither side expects the other to see a value for
// exactly one of its own cycles:
//
//   clk_c -> clk  values that stay until answered. A read or a device access
//                 is put in the rq_* registers and announced by turning rq_t
//                 over; the write pointer of the FIFO below only ever counts
//                 up.
//   clk -> clk_c  values that last one cycle of clk, which the faster clk_c
//                 samples once or twice. A word read from the SDRAM comes
//                 with its number's low bit (r_seq), so the second sample is
//                 known for what it is; a device's acknowledge is taken once,
//                 the request it answers being over with it.
//
// The stores are not in the CPU's write buffer here (mips_core's XWB): each
// leaves the CPU as it is done and goes through a FIFO written on clk_c and
// read on clk. The arbiter gets the SDRAM's one after the other, with no gap
// while there are any (a run: a write among another port's reads costs the
// bus its turn), begun with four waiting, when the oldest has waited, or when
// the CPU asks for anything else. A device's store goes to the device port
// from the FIFO's head, in its turn. The order the CPU asked in is kept: a
// read or a device's read is begun only when every store before it has gone
// to the arbiter -- what a device access sets off (a DMA, a task) may read
// that word.
