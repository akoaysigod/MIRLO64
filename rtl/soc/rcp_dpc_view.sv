// The DPC registers as the console shows them to a reader, over rdp_dpc.sv's:
//   - DPC_START written while START is valid (written and END not yet) is ignored (start_ok; systemtest "Writes to start
//     address should be ignored while start-valid is set"),
//   - DPC_STATUS' layout: 0 XBUS, 1 FREEZE, 2 FLUSH, 3 START_GCLK, 4 TMEM busy (never), 5 PIPE busy, 6 cmd busy (never),
//     7 CBUF ready (always), 8 DMA busy (commands between CURRENT and END), 9 END valid, 10 START valid. START_GCLK and
//     PIPE_BUSY are set by a write of END (not while frozen) and by the unfreeze, and stay until the RDP completes a SYNC FULL
//     (PIPE_BUSY also by the STATUS write's bit 7); so after a list the register reads 0xA8, as the systemtest waits for.
// (rdp_dpc.sv's own status had the bits 3..6 all as "the RDP is busy" and no DMA busy.)
