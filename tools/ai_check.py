"""Checks the AI in hardware (rtl/soc/rcp_ai.sv) against the algorithm of the runtime's software AI (lang/n64rt/n64rt_rsp.c,
ai_service / fetch_frame), from the bench's AILOG (sim/mips_soc/tb_soc.cpp, a SoC built with MIRLO_AI):

    tools/ai_check.py AILOG [--lcg | --snap] [--tv ntsc|pal|mpal]

AILOG's lines: F <word> a frame the reader fetched (L high, R low), S <step> the resampler's step, O <word> <silence> a word
written to the Pocket's FIFO, R the reader started over, I an interrupt, W ... a register write. The software's algorithm
is run over the frames in the order they were fetched, with the step as it was when each word was written, and its words
are compared with the hardware's real (not silence) words, sample for sample: the count of words, the RMS and the largest
error (of the 16-bit samples) are printed. With --snap the frames fetched must also be the buffers as they were when the game
handed them over (the bench's B lines: a buffer changed after it was handed over would be read changed). The silence words must be zero. With --lcg the frames must also be the pattern of
lang/mips/test/ai_test.c (its LCG from seed 1, a frame a word).  Exit status 0 if the stream is the same."""
